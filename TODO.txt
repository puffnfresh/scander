- Fill out this todo list.
- Make newly edited file be subtly highlighted in listing when returning back from edit mode("exiting")
* Make uploaded files highlighted
- Ability to rename - preferably in place, turning the file/directory name text into a text field and updating it using AJAX
* Come up with a better method to tell whether or not changes have been made to a text field. onchange event does not get invoked until the text area has been blurred
* System shell
* Add checkboxes next to every file/directory so that actions can be ran on multiple items
* Fix edit mode - stop it from messing up weird (UTF-16, I think) characters
* Add ability to create new directories
* Add better looking icon for rename
* Add ability to sort by columns
