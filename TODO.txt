- Fill out this todo list.
* Make newly edited file be subtly highlighted in listing when returning back from edit mode("exiting")
* Ability to rename - preferably in place, turning the file/directory name text into a text field and updating it using AJAX
* Use "?action=new" instead of using an extra GET variable (p)
* Come up with a better method to tell whether or not changes have been made to a text field. onchange event does not get invoked until the text area has been blurred
* System shell / PHP eval
* Add checkboxes next to every file/directory so that actions can be ran on multiple items
* An upload applet
